## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my second project using Sass, and I'm starting to like it a lot, although I still need some practice to learn how to use it most efficiently.

### Continued development

I will continue working on my front end development skills, especially learning to exploit Sass.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Color Filters](https://css-tricks.com/color-filters-can-turn-your-gray-skies-blue/) - I found this a neat trick to add the orange color to the second picture of the keyboard. Using a background color and opacity works, but makes the image look too washed out.
